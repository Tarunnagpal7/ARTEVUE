DEPLOYEENT :
   XAMPP simplifies the process of developing and testing dynamic web applications locally before deploying them to a live server. It bundles together several components necessary for web development, including:

Apache: XAMPP includes the Apache HTTP Server, which serves as the web server software. Apache processes HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and delivers web pages and other content.
MySQL: XAMPP comes pre-installed with MySQL, a popular relational database management system. MySQL is used to store and manage the website's data, such as user information, artwork details, and orders.
PHP: XAMPP includes PHP, a server-side scripting language widely used for web development. PHP scripts are executed on the server to generate dynamic web pages, interact with databases, and handle user authentication and session management.
Perl: XAMPP also includes Perl, a programming language commonly used for tasks such as text processing and system administration. While not as commonly used in web development as PHP, Perl can be useful for certain server-side tasks.
Deployment on localhost:

Deploying your website on localhost using XAMPP involves the following steps:

Installation: Download and install the XAMPP package compatible with your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Starting the Servers: Launch the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL servers. These servers will run locally on your computer, allowing you to access your website via a web browser.
Project Setup: Place your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, etc.) in the appropriate directory within the "htdocs" folder in the XAMPP installation directory. This is where Apache will serve your website files from.
Database Configuration: Use phpMyAdmin, a web-based administration tool included with XAMPP, to create and manage your MySQL databases. Import your database schema and populate it with data as needed.
Accessing Your Website: Open a web browser and navigate to "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" followed by the name of your website's directory in the "htdocs" folder. You should see your website running locally, and you can interact with it just like you would on a live server.
Deploying your website on localhost using XAMPP provides a convenient and efficient way to develop, test, and debug your web applications in a controlled environment before making them accessible to the public on a live server.

Using PHPMyAdmin:

To create tables and add data using the database.sql file in PHPMyAdmin, follow these steps:

Access PHPMyAdmin: Open a web browser and navigate to the PHPMyAdmin interface provided by your local server (e.g., http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
Login: Log in to PHPMyAdmin using your credentials.
Select Database: Choose the database where you want to create tables and import data. If the database doesn't exist, you may need to create it first.
Import SQL File: Look for an option to import SQL files within PHPMyAdmin. Select the database.sql file from your local directory and upload it.
Execute SQL Commands: PHPMyAdmin will execute the SQL commands in the database.sql file sequentially, creating tables and inserting data into them.
Verification: After the import process is complete, verify that the tables and data have been successfully added to the database by browsing through the database structure and viewing the table contents.
